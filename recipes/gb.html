    <h3>What's for dinner tonight?</h3>

    <p>My family can all agree on one thing as a side for dinner. 
        Garlic Bread. It's the go-to in our house, and I'm sure it is in many of 
        your homes too! After all, who can resist that delicious garlic flavor mixed 
        with cheese and a crispy outside edge?! Garlic bread is a delicious and easy 
        side to make and one of the fastest things to go.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>French Bread</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Garlic Powder</li>
            <li>Garlic Cloves</li>
            <li>Italian Seasoning</li>
            <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
            <li>Parsley</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat Oven and Cut the Bread:</strong> Preheat oven to 400 degrees. 
                Cut your French bread loaf lengthwise and place on top of a baking sheet.</li>
            <li><strong>Make Spread:</strong> In a small bowl combine softened butter, 
                garlic powder, minced garlic, Italian seasoning and shredded cheese.

            <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake the bread in the oven for 12-15 minutes until the butter 
                melts. You can also broil the top for 1-2 minutes at the end to give it a more crisp top.</li>
